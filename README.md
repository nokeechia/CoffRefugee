This project consists of three interacting applications.

- Python backend (flask)
- Consumer Web app
- Overview Web app.

To begin, start the backend by running the following with python 3.4:

app.py

You can access the two web applications from the following URLs:

hostingSite:5000/webapp/index.html
http://nckr.azurewebsites.net/

The first lets you simulate a purchase.
The second, shows infomation about Merchants and vouchers.

You can simulate a "gifting" event by using the "Redeem Voucher in Pool" button on the POS app.
